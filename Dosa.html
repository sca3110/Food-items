    <img src="Dosa.jpg">
    <h3> ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Rice</li>
        <li> Urad dal (black gram lentils)
        </li>
        <li> Fenugreek seeds (methi seeds)
        </li>
        <li>Salt </li>
        <li> Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    
<ol> 
<li> Wash and soak the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds separately in enough water for at least 4-6 hours, or preferably overnight.</li>
<li> Drain the soaked ingredients and rinse them thoroughly.</li>
<li>In a blender or wet grinder, grind the soaked rice and urad dal separately to a smooth paste, adding water gradually as needed. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter. </li>
<li>Combine the ground rice and urad dal batter in a large bowl. Add salt to taste and mix well. </li>
<li>Cover the bowl with a clean cloth or lid and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight. The batter should rise and become slightly fluffy. </li>
<li> After fermentation, gently stir the batter. If it is too thick, add a little water to adjust the consistency to a pourable batter consistency.
</li>
<li>Heat a non-stick or cast iron griddle (tava) over medium-high heat. </li>
<li>Once the griddle is hot, pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the griddle and quickly spread it in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer (similar to a crepe). </li>
<li> Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the bottom turns golden brown and crispy.</li>
<li>Flip the dosa using a spatula and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes, or until lightly browned and crisp. </li>
<li> Remove the dosa from the griddle and serve hot with chutney and sambar.</li>
<li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter, stirring the batter gently before making each dosa. </li>
<li> Enjoy your homemade dosas!</li>

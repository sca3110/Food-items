    <h2> Instructions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Wash the rice: Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
        </li>

        <li> Soak the rice: Soak the washed rice in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Marinate the meat: If using chicken, mutton, beef, fish, shrimp, or vegetables, marinate with yogurt,
            ginger-garlic paste, salt, and biryani spices (like turmeric, red chili powder, cumin, coriander powder) for
            at least 30 minutes to overnight in the refrigerator. </li>
        <li> Fry onions: Heat ghee or oil in a large pot. Fry sliced onions until golden brown and crispy. Remove and
            set aside for garnishing.</li>
        <li> Cook the meat (if using): In the same pot, fry ginger-garlic paste until fragrant. Add marinated meat and
            cook until it changes color and is partially cooked</li>
        <li> Layering the biryani: </li>
        <li> Dissolve saffron: Dissolve saffron strands in warm milk and drizzle over the top layer of rice</li>
        <li> Sealing the pot: Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal with aluminum foil to trap steam.</li>
        <li> Cook on low heat: Cook on low heat (dum) for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice
            to cook through</li>
        <li> After 20-25 minutes, check if the rice is cooked and the meat (if using) is tender. If not, cover and cook
            for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fried onions, fresh cilantro, and mint leaves. Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) or salan
            (spicy curry). </li>
